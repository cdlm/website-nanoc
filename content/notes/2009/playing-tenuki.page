I know, this is yet *another* re-opening-my-blog blog post ;)

I've already maintained a blog before; it was a [Typo][] instance running on a venerable [Sun Ultra 5][ultra5] workstation behind my home DSL. As you can guess, Ruby on a 360MHz CPU is *not* fast, so it was getting painful to edit, and then I moved to Swiss, and the poor server got neglected.

However, I now maintain these static web pages using [Webgen][], which has recently been given blog support by [Matteo Collina][matteo]. Fiddle, hack, tweak, and here's the result.

## Why the name?

[Tenuki](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tenuki) is a term from the [game of Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Go) that denotes ignoring the current local battle and just playing somewhere else.

Rather than a blog focused on a particular topic, this will be a repository of short writings on various subjects, probably quite geeky but not necessarily entirely related to research or even computer science; in fact, if I had to gather all that will appear here in a book, I would probably entitle it *The Art of Computer Procrastinating*.

## The spark

Actually [Nicolas][] pointed me to [Sacha Chua][]'s presentation [*The Shy Connector*][shy], where she makes some good points for us introverts. Apparently people will talk to you if they already know that you can help. Who knew ? ;)

So, let these pages be my conversation-with-strangers baits! *Mwa-ha-ha.*

## What now?
Below is a quick brain dump of things I could write about ---or already have, but need to dig them up--- when I get myself to it (or someone pushes me enough).

- Typography, graphic design

- LaTeX tips & tricks (setup, workflow, commands, packages)

- unix configuration stuff (svn, seaside with apache/lighttpd ?)

- Go

- Graphics

- Books, Science-fiction, Smalltalk

- Explaining reflection and bootstrap, the neuro-surgeon metaphor

- Misc links like [What To Know Before Debating Type Systems](http://www.pphsg.org/cdsmith/types.html), Dale's [Smalltalk 101](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/smalltalk-101/), Stef's [list of free books](http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks.html), or [general recommendations](http://mleddy.blogspot.com/2005/01/how-to-e-mail-professor.html)

- Machine naming schemes (eldar, cameo/fallawater, tombolimbes, chepa, tenuki, tsuke, hane, keima, komi, kikashi, kakeme, fuseki)

- *…any suggestion ?*
