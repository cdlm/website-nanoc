###### Why the name?
[Tenuki](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tenuki) is a term from the [game of Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Go) that denotes ignoring the current local battle and just playing somewhere else.
So these pages will be like a blog or a repository of short writings on various subjects, probably quite geeky but not necessarily entirely related to research or even computer science; in fact, if I had to gather all that will appear here in a book, I would probably entitle it *The Art of Computer Procrastinating*.
