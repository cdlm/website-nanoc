###### Why the name?
[Tenuki](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tenuki) is a term from the [game of Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Go) that denotes ignoring the current local battle and just playing somewhere else.
While this is a professional website, I don't want to keep a strict editorial line about my research interests, or even about computer science in general; in fact, another title idea was *The Art of Computer Procrastinating*.
