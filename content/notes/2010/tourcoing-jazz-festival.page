Mid-october is the time for jazz lovers around Lille, with the [Tourcoing Jazz Festival][tjf].
This year it was from Oct. 16th to 23rd, and I suspect whoever invited the artists must have peeked at my music library; I just _had_ to get the whole-week pass.

## Saturday: Renaud García-Fons

[![Renaud García-Fons, La Línea del Sur (2009)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/la-linea-del-sur.jpg)][linea]{: .right}

The festival opened with a concert in Mouscron, near Tourcoing, but on the belgian side of the border, where 5km are more than enough for a poor french driver to get lost…

But I digress :)

[Renaud García-Fons][rgf] is a virtuoso at crossing the colors of mediterranean musics with the fantastic voice of his five-string double bass.
The concert was based on [_La Línea del Sur_][linea]; Sabrina danced flamenco in a couple compositions, answering the three others with the taps of her feet.
I couldn't help but imagine Zakir Hussain conversing with her in ultrafast tabla beats…

- [Renaud García-Fons][rgf]: bass,
- [David Venitucci](http://www.davidvenitucci.fr): accordion,
- [Kiko Ruis](http://www.myspace.com/kikoruiz): guitar,
- [Sabrina Romero](http://www.myspace.com/sabrinaromero): cajon, vocals, dance.

## Sunday: Dhafer Youssef, Omar Sosa & Trilok Gurtu

[![Dhafer Youssef, Abu Nawas Rhapsody (2010)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/abu-nawas-rhapsody.jpg)][abunawas]{: .right}

[Dhafer Youssef][]'s quartet opened this concert in the best way possible, with pieces from his [project dedicated to 8th century poet Abu Nawas][abunawas], intermixing energetic and joyful rhythms with contemplative singing. Wonderful.
At the piano was an [amazing young armenian](http://liveweb.arte.tv/fr/video/Tigran_Hamasyan_au_festival_Souillac_en_Jazz/), [Tigran Hamasyan][]; Dhafer said he was proud to be part of his career, and, seeing how at 23 he's already played with Chick Corea or Avishai Cohen, I can understand :)

- [Dhafer Youssef][]: oud, vocals,
- [Tigran Hamasyan][]: piano,
- [Chris Jennings](http://chrisjenningsbass.com): bass,
- [Mark Guiliana](http://www.markguiliana.com): drums.

[![Omar Sosa, Afreecanos (2008)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/afreecanos.jpg)][afreecanos]{: .right}

The second set was [Omar Sosa][]'s quartet, plus indian master [Trilok Gurtu][] as a special guest.
This was clearly more free-form, experimental jazz, incorporating electronics and samples, and under constant moment-to-moment mutation.
Definitely on my to-listen list.

- [Omar Sosa][]: piano, rhodes,
- [Trilok Gurtu][]: tabla, cajon, misc. percussions,
- [Childo Thomas](http://www.myspace.com/childotomas): bass guitar, vocals,
- [Leandro Saint Hill](http://www.myspace.com/leandrosainthill): soprano & alto saxophones, flute,
- [Marque Gilmore](http://www.drumfm.com/home.html): drums.

This concert was co-organized by the [Tourcoing Planètes Jazz Festival][tjf] and the [Jazz en Nord Festival][jen], which organizes events along the year.

## Tuesday: Stefan Orins trio, McCoy Tyner quartet

The trio of [Stefan & Peter Orins and Christophe Hache](http://www.myspace.com/stefanorins) is a very local group; I saw them last year at [La Malterie](http://www.lamalterie.com/), a bar / concert cave / artist residence in Lille, where they regularly [play](http://www.lamalterie.com/fr/evenement/concert/stefan-orins-trio-sortie-de-disque) or collaborate with the resident musicians, in particular in the various projects of [Olivier Benoît](http://obenoitmusic.free.fr/indexbis.htm). They were playing songs from [their next album, Stöt][stot].

- Stefan Orins: piano,
- Christophe Hache: bass,
- Peter Orins: drums.

[![McCoy Tyner Quartet (2008)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/mccoy.jpg)][mccoy]{: .right}

Following them, was some guy that was way to old and too respected by the rest of the audience for me to just discover now: [McCoy Tyner][] and his quartet. This was clearly a different class of jazz, much cleaner, polished and refined.
Maybe too much? I have to admit I tend to prefer the youngsters that play Jazz versions of Nirvana songs :)

- [McCoy Tyner][]: piano,
- Gérald Canon: bass,
- Eric Kamau Gravatt: drums,
- Gary Bartz: saxophones.

## Wednesday: Ibrahim Maalouf, Rabih Abou-Khalil

[![Ibrahim Maalouf, Diachronism (2009)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/diachronism.jpg)][aljadida]{: .right}

I already saw [Ibrahim Maalouf][] at an open-air festival this summer, but was really happy to have another chance in a smaller setting.
He has lots of enthusiasm and energy on stage, and it shows in his music and his contact with the public.

- [Ibrahim Maalouf][]: trumpet,
- Benjamin Molinaro: bass guitar,
- Frank Woeste: fender road,
- Nenad Gajin: guitar,
- Xavier Roge: drums.

[![Rabih Abou-Khalil, Al-Jadida (1991)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/al-jadida.jpg)][aljadida]{: .right}

I knew [Rabih Abou-Khalil][] from his old works, in particular [_Al Jadida_][aljadida], and his music really touched me.
On stage, he revealed to be a really funny guy, adept of tongue-in-cheek humour, wearing his shirt color-coordinated with the group's tuba (why, yes, a turquoise tuba), and dedicating a song to "this monument of british cuisine, the fish-n-ships". Enlightening.

- [Rabih Abou-Khalil][]: oud,
- [Ricardo Ribeiro](http://www.myspace.com/ricardoribeirofado): vocals, saxophone,
- Luciano Biondini: accordion,
- [Michel Godard](http://www.michel-godard.fr): tuba, serpent, bass guitar,
- [Jarrod Cagwin](http://jarrodcagwin.com): drums, percussions.

This concert was filmed and [Rabih Abou-Khalil's performance can be watched on Arte Liveweb](http://liveweb.arte.tv/fr/video/Le_Rabih_Abou-Khalil_Quintet_au_Tourcoing_Jazz_Festival/); Ibrahim Maalouf was also recorded but sadly it does not seem to be online.

## Thursday: Portico quartet, Manu Katché

[![Portico Quartet, Isla (2009)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/isla.jpg)][isla]{: .right}

The discovery: [Portico quartet](http://porticoquartet.com).
They were announced as the recent revelation, and indeed they were a very good surprise.
The [hang](http://www.hangdrum.com/) and electronics come together to create _their_ sonic atmosphere, somewhere between jazz and electro.

- Duncan Bellamy: drums,
- Milo Fitzpatrick: bass,
- Nicholas Mulvey: hang,
- Jack Wyllie: saxophone.

[![Manu Katché, Third Round (2010)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/third-round.jpg)][thirdround]{: .right}

The disappointment: [Manu Katché][manu].
He played with Jan Garbarek or Anouar Brahem, whose music always grabs me from inside, so I had high hopes.
Unfortunately, all we got was clean, consensual jazz, played by good musicians but with too much ease… boring[^talking].

- [Manu Katché][manu]: drums,
- Petter Wettre: saxophone,
- Alfio Origlio: piano, Fender Rhodes,
- Laurent Vernerey: bass guitar.

[^talking]: Though certainly not that boring to the middle-aged ladies next row, who didn't chat as much as during Portico's set. And then the younger generations get blamed for their lack of manners?


## Friday: Henri Texier, Dave Holland

This is a concert centered on the bass, with two great masters.

[Henri Texier][] is very sensible to the problems humanity faces, be it political or ecological, with pieces like _Louisiana Dark Waters_, from the next album; a very humane set.

- [Henri Texier][]: bass,
- [Sébastien Texier](http://www.myspace.com/sebastientexier): alto saxophone, clarinet,
- [Francesco Bearzatti](http://www.francescobearzatti.com): tenor saxophone, clarinet,
- [Manu Codjia](http://www.myspace.com/manucodjia): guitar,
- [Christophe Marguet](http://www.christophemarguet.net): drums.

[Henri Texier]: http://www.label-bleu.com/artist.php?artist_id=91

[Dave Holland][] is a giant, both figuratively and literally; but then he was playing one of these acousting road basses with a truncated belly, so that was cheating a bit :)

- [Robin Eubanks](http://www.robineubanks.com): trombone,
- [Dave Holland][]: bass,
- [Steve Nelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nelson_(vibraphonist)): vibraphone, marimba,
- [Chris Potter](http://www.chrispottermusic.com): saxophone,
- [Nate Smith](http://www.myspace.com/waterbabymusic): drums.

## Saturday: Marcus Strickland, Wayne Shorter

[![Marcus Strickland trio, Idiosyncrasies (2009)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/idiosyncrasies.jpg)][idiosyncrasies]{: .right}

[Marcus Strickland][] seemed quite impressed to open for Wayne Shorter, but then is there a jazz saxophonist out there who wouldn't?
I particularly liked the story with the strikes in France and how they had to repeatedly suffer hearing one of their themes as the train company's jingle :)

- [Marcus Strickland][]: saxophone,
- [Joe Sanders](http://joesandersbass.com): bass,
- E.J. Strickland: drums.

[Marcus Strickland]: http://www.marcusstrickland.com
[idiosyncrasies]: http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B002HJZ5DO?ie=UTF8&tag=playingtenuki-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1642&creative=19458&creativeASIN=B002HJZ5DO

[Wayne Shorter][] and his quartet played three pieces.
The first one started slow, but then took us to a succession of places and we followed the masters on their voyage.

The other two pieces? the _two encores_.
Just barely enough to let the audience recover from the trip and land back somewhere in reality.

- [Wayne Shorter][]: saxophone,
- [Danilo Perez](http://www.daniloperez.com): piano,
- [John Patitucci](http://www.johnpatitucci.com): bass,
- [Brian Blade](http://www.brianblade.com): drums.
